# fantasiaweb
See https://github.com/lithium-umbreon/fantasia for detailed installation instructions, but in this case, download the release from here!

Copy over the audio folder into the folder in which the HTML and image files reside (might be in a separate folder named "fantasiaweb").

Open the HTML file in your preferred browser, select the audio folder (there will be a popup which tells you where the folder should be), hit play and enjoy!
